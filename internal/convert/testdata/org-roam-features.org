* Org-Roam Specific Features

This file tests org-roam-specific features.

* ROAM_REFS Property

The file-level ROAM_REFS property above contains:
- A URL: https://example.com/article
- A citation key: cite:smith2024

These unique identifiers help link external content to this note.

* Headline-Level Nodes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: headline-node-uuid-1234
:ROAM_ALIASES: "Subnode"
:END:

This is a headline-level node with its own ID. In org-roam v2, headlines with an ID property become nodes themselves.

** Nested Headline Node
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: nested-node-uuid-5678
:END:

Even nested headlines can be nodes!

* ID Links

Standard org-roam ID links work as expected:

Link to another note: [[id:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000][Related Note]]

Link to a headline node: [[id:headline-node-uuid-1234][Subnode]]
